# CubeSolver(incomplete) (2020.11~2020.12)
### The purpose was to 'Help you to Learn to solve Rubix Cube easily'  
### So I composed algorithm with easiest way of solving rubix cube  
##### Successfully implemented 3x3x3 rubix cube 3d model on the web and animated the solution process.  
##### Then I tried to provide a solution for user's case by analyzing the cube's status with a camera using OpenCV,  
##### *__but__* it hasn't been long since I started studying programming, so I put it off to do it later.


###### I'm so lazy...
